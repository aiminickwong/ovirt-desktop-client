* Migrate oVirt code to 4.X.X version. While ovirt-engine-sdk-python version 3.X.X is compatible with oVirt API 4.0.0, in the future this backwards compatibility will be removed. The oVirt code should all be rewritten to 4.X.X format.
* Implement the "multitenant" mode (showing machines of multiple instances of oVirt into the same application).
* Implement an "unexitable" mode (for Kiosk mode).
* Include an option to make the main window modal.
